summary: "A group project I participated in for my ICS 212 course which functions to manage a hotel."

This program written in C++ was created for the purpose of managing a hotel, which was a culmination of efforts from me and 5 other classmates for our ICS 212 course. The specific functions of the program include managing rooms (which includes adding, searching, and deleting rooms), checking rooms in, searching for available rooms, searching for customers, checking out rooms, and finally a guest summary report. This project was extensive, therefore all these functions were split amongst the group, and I was assigned the tasks of creating a room class, as well as the managing rooms function which also had the addition, searching, and deletion of rooms.
