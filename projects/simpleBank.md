summary: "A program which functions as a simplistic banking system."
---
This project was an endeavor to create a program which could function as a banking system. 
This meant it had to have the basic functions of checking the account balance, depositing a certain amount, and withdrawing a certain amount. Checking the account balance consisted of returning the value of a global balance value, initialized at 0 right at the beginning of the program. Depositing and withdrawing are straight forward as well, which adds or subtracts to the global balance value, based on the users choice in the menu display.

I had the role of both planning out and developing the code for this project, since it was a solo project. Recieving a prompt of what the program has to do was all that was given, so it was challenging to come up with a reasonable choice of action and then implement it into code. I learned a lot from this specific project because at first I found it much more challenging, and that was because I overthought more than I needed to. This project and its ups and downs through its creation taught me valuable lessons about reviewing prompts / requirements and finding the balance of efficiency and quality; a program that did what was required but also add some sense of thoughtfulness whether it be in the users interface or maybe a choice in code which runs more efficiently than another. 

The following is a snapshot of the code.
